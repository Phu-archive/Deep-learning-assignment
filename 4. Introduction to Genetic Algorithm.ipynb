    "\n",
    "1. There is population of animal X.\n",
    "2. Each of them have genes that will effect their characteristic.\n",
    "3. Their characteristic can causes them to have difference Fitness(rank among group)\n",
    "4. The higher the fitness the higher the chance of mating.\n",
    "5. When they mate they create the offsprings.\n",
    "7. Offsprings' gene may mutate a little.\n",
    "6. This process repeats ,and hopefully the fitness will go up.\n",

    "This theorem is about monkey that type on a keyboard randomly, and some how they will finish the complete stories of William Shakespeare.\n",

    "Lets just make this monkey type just the sentences in [Macbeth](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/full.html) : \"fair is foul, and foul is fair\" The monkey will type randomly and we hopefully get the sentence."

    "## Genetic Algorithm is important !!\n",
    "\n",
    "What genetic algorithm provides us is that we can run the monkey using genetic algorithm <i> successfully </i> in our lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "But first, we have to look at the algorithm in details. I will divide each part in to sections then we will implement it in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Create the start population.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our start population would be list of random genes. And, these random genes will be the ancestors of our next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Evaulate the fitness\n",
    "\n",
    "We,then, have to define the fitness function. Fitness function is used to evaluate the fitness of individual genes. We do this because the fitter the genes are the higher chance they will mate together. The fitness function will be the number of same characters between the gene and the target sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Selection process\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually there are many ways we can select the mating gene, but we are going to use tournament selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only 2 steps for the selecting process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We select genes randomly for number of rounds(we will define this when we actually program. Usually, it is 6 ) times.\n",
    "2. In these genes, we get the fittest.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Mating and mutate\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do next is to run the loop to get the next generation with the same population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subprocess\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, we select mom and dad genes.\n",
    "2. Then, we make the mate.\n",
    "3. Then, we roll a dice whether the child's gene will be mutate.\n",
    "4. Finally, we add the child gene to the next generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crossover/Mating\n",
    "\n",
    "For example we have 2 dad and mom genes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Section4img/DadAndMum.jpeg\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we random the number where we will cut the list(the random would be between 0 and length of gene)\n",
    "In this case the program randoms the number to be 2\n",
    "\n",
    "so, the first 2 characters of dad's gene will be merge with last 4 characters of mom's gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Section4img/Kid.jpeg\" >\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mutation \n",
    "\n",
    "We will run the list of genes and roll the dice with spacific probability(it is just a symbol of probability. In this case the probability will be 1 in 100 chance) at the same time. If there is going to be change in gene, we will replace the old character with randomly pulled character from the pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Discard the old generation and repeat the process until we get the result we want."

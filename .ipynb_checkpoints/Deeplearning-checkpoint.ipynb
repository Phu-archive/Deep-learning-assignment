    "## What is machine learning ???\n",
    "\n",
    "For me, the best definition for machine learning would be: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Machine Learning gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\"\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Arthur Samuel, 1959\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To be more specific, I will give you the examples of type of learning algorithms and some examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How machine learning works ?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we were young, we were learning about the numbers and alphabets; in order to idenitfy the correct numbers and alphabets, we had to go through some excercises and seeing difference people writing in difference style. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to how people learn, machine uses examples( a lot of them too ) in order to find some pattern in the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are calling examples that we use to \"fit\" the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/AndrewNg.png\">\n",
    "Here is the picture used in Andrew Ng's lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can't understand this you may trying to look at the examples from difference sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Learning is the first type of learning algorithm that we are going to talk about. In a nutshell, it has 2 components : Training set and label. Label is the correct answer, for example, in digit classificiation, the training set the pictures of handwritten digit and the label is that number.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this type of learning, the algorithm will know the correct answer before and it will try to create the model that will give out the correct answer provided the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Trying to identify the handwritten digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting the house price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iris Data Set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the best-fit for graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/Supervised-learning1.jpeg\" style=\"width:450px;height:300px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "With the purple boundary, we can find the class of green dot (which will be blue).\n",
    "\n",
    "The color of red and blue represent difference classes data can be. And, all the dots (both red and blue) will be the data that will give the clue for algorithm to find the best purple boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike supervised Learning, unsupervised learning doesn't require a label. This may sound a little weird at first but given the examples, you will understand more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cocktail party problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we are in the party with other people, although we don't know who they are, we can still differentiate the sound of difference people. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be call unsupervised learning because the learning algorithm doesn't need labels, what it only needs is just the mixed sound of people talking together.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try this problem here : http://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/cocktail/cocktail_en.cgi\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can be viewed as \"grouping the data together\",for example, k-nearest neighbors algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classification problem\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the problem when we want to identify difference data and seperate them to diffence catagory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handwritten digits recognition problem is one type of Supervised Classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way algorithm works is tofind the boundary that will differentiate difference classes. Just like green dot example !!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regression problem\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the problem when we output the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, predicting the house price using the appoch of finding the best fit for graph(this can be called linear regression. We will take a look at this more)."
